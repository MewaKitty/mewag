						<h2>ThunderClan</h2>
						<span>Ponder Skill +1</span>
					</div>
					<div class="content">
						While all the Clans enjoy times of peace and relative
						calm, ThunderClan is probably the Clan that does the
						most to promote quiet coexistence for all cats. These
						cats are respectful of other Clans, their habits, and
						their territories. ThunderClan has a long history of
						speaking out against injustice and seeking to mediate
						differences between individual cats and even whole
						Clans. While Thunderclan cats believe strongly in living
						up to both the letter and the intent of the warrior
						code, they also are not afraid to challenge traditions
						and laws that seem unfair. ThunderClan is most
						interested in seeing that all cats are treated with
						justice and respect. Some Clans interpret ThunderClan’s
						willingness to compromise as a weakness. They believe
						that the Clan spends so much time talking about
						“fairness” because they lack the strength to protect
						themselves from aggressors. But the members of
						ThunderClan are more than ready to back up their beliefs
						with tooth and claw if necessary.

						<h2>RiverClan</h2>
						<span>Swim Skill +1</span>
					</div>
					<div class="content">
						Each Clan has many impressive qualities, but members of
						RiverClan are especially proud of their Clan and its
						history. Cats in this Clan tend to be sleek and have
						long, glossy coats. RiverClan cats are fiercely
						self-sufficient. Because of their close ties to the
						water, RiverClan cats are usually excellent swimmers who
						don’t mind being wet the way other cats often do. Some
						other Clans think that RiverClan is a little too proud,
						and that makes it more difficult for them to weather
						hard times. But the members of RiverClan say that they
						only do what every other Clan does—use any means
						necessary to keep themselves strong and healthy.

						<h2>WindClan</h2>
						<span>Listen Skill +1</span>
					</div>
					<div class="content">
						Every Clan suffers through difficult times occasionally,
						but WindClan has a more troubled history than most.
						These cats are the most susceptible to extremes of
						weather and incursions by animals, Twolegs, and even
						other cats. But in the end they always come back to
						reclaim what is theirs. Cats in WindClan must be quick
						and have extra-sharp senses (particularly hearing) in
						order to successfully hunt on the open moor. As a
						result, they are especially difficult to take by
						surprise. Some other Clans interpret WindClan’s history
						of coming and going as indicating that these cats are
						cowardly—running away from threats rather than facing
						them. They think that living on a barren plain has made
						them soft, weak, and unfit to be called warriors. But
						the cats of WindClan will point out that there is no
						honor to be gained from unnecessary fighting. And no one
						has ever succeeded in permanently taking territory away
						from their Clan.

						<h2>ShadowClan</h2>
						<span>Sneak Skill +1</span>
					</div>
					<div class="content">
						All of the Clans value their privacy, but none more so
						than ShadowClan. Members pride themselves on being the
						most aggressive and battle-hardened Clan cats, always
						ready for a fight and never needing to bow their heads
						or give concessions to anyone. Living in the wildest of
						territories, they believe that survival of the fittest
						is a basic part of the warrior code. If a Clan cannot
						defend its territory against invasion, then that Clan
						doesn’t deserve that land after all. If you’re strong,
						clever, or sneaky enough to get something, then it
						rightfully belongs to you. Some Clans interpret
						ShadowClan’s aggression and deception as proof that
						these cats are nothing more than battle hungry,
						untrustworthy sneaks. But the cats of ShadowClan believe
						they have the truest warriors of any Clan, and if anyone
						wants to contest that claim they’ll have to back it up
						with claws and fury.
